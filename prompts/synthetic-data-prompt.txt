You will GENERATE synthetic equivalence pairs between a free-form course/title phrase (A) and its canonical concept label (B). No external data is provided; invent all content.

GOAL
Produce realistic, domain-diverse pairs where A and B are lexically or conceptually coextensive (same scope/level). Each line is one tab-separated pair: A<TAB>B.

QUANTITY & DIVERSITY
- Generate 100 pairs.
- Cover at least 12 distinct domains (e.g., government/policy, law, literature, languages, math/stats, CS/IT, data/AI, business/marketing, health/medicine, psychology, arts/design, music, environmental studies, education/pedagogy, engineering).
- Ensure no exact-duplicate A or B rows.

EQUIVALENCE (INCLUDE ONLY IF A ≡ B)
- Rephrasing/ordering: “Animals and Ethics” ≡ “animal ethics”
- Head inversion that preserves meaning: “Law in Business” ≡ “business law”
- Morphology variants: plural/singular, gerunds, hyphenation, case changes
- Minor noise stripped: credits/flags (“(3)”, “(*)”, “[Honors]”, “: A Survey”) when they do NOT change scope
- Acronyms/expansions: “U.S. Government” ≡ “american government”; “EHR” ≡ “electronic health records” (only when unambiguous)
- Spelling variants & common misspellings: “Goverment” ≡ “government”
- Synonymic flips with standard phrasing: “Food Chemistry” ≡ “chemistry of food” ≡ “food chemistry”
- Canonicalization to a standard noun phrase for B (lowercase unless proper nouns)

EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT GENERATE)
- Hierarchical narrowing/broadening: “Advanced”, “Applied”, “Topics in”, “I/II/III”, “Lab”, “Workshop”, domain qualifiers (e.g., “Clinical”, “Pediatric”, “Italian”) UNLESS B contains the same qualifier (then it’s not equivalent; avoid).
- Different domains or facet-adding pairs: “Advertising and Marketing” vs canonical “Advertising” (not equivalent)
- Sequence/level differences: “Introductory …”, “Honors …”, “Graduate …” vs a plain B
- Compound vs simple when meaning expands or restricts: “Business Law and Ethics” ≠ “business law”

CANONICAL LABEL (B) RULES
- Make B concise, unambiguous, and standard (e.g., “american government”, “retail marketing”, “public policy research methods”).
- Prefer singular noun phrases unless the field is customarily plural (“statistics”, “world literatures” is okay if used consistently).
- Keep B consistent across multiple A variants within a micro-domain cluster (e.g., several A lines mapping to the same B).

A VARIATION MIX (TARGET DISTRIBUTION)
- ~30% word-order flips/coordinations (“X and Y” ↔ “Y and X”).
- ~20% acronyms/expansions (EHR/Electronic Health Records; AI/Artificial Intelligence) when unambiguous.
- ~20% orthographic/punctuation variants (&, /, :, -, parentheses).
- ~15% spelling variants/typos that remain clear.
- ~15% synonymic paraphrases that maintain exact scope.

QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE OUTPUT
- If a modifier in A changes scope relative to B, discard or adjust to true equivalence.
- If a pair feels broader/narrower or cross-domain, discard.
- Ensure each B appears in 1–5 pairs maximum to avoid overconcentration.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
- Return ONLY the pairs as tab-separated values, wrapped in triple backticks.
- No headers, no commentary, no numbering.
- Preserve original casing for A; use standardized lowercase for B except proper nouns.
