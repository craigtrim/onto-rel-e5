You will receive search results for a single canonical course concept **B**.
Each row is a candidate course title **A** paired with **B**.
Your task is to decide the ontological relationship between **A** and **B** (type, subclass, or synonym).

RULES

Interpretation
1) Treat **B** as a general concept/class (e.g., “animated art”).
2) Treat **A** as a candidate subclass, instance, or synonym of **B** (e.g., “Animation II (Art)”).

Hierarchy & Scope
- Prefer **hierarchical reasoning** over synonymy.
- If **A** has scope modifiers (e.g., “Mathematical,” “Computational,” “Applied,” “Advanced,” “I/II,” “Topics in,” etc.), treat **A** as a **narrower subclass** of **B**.
- Mark **synonyms (both True)** only if **A** and **B** are lexically/conceptually coextensive—same abstraction and scope (e.g., “Art and Animation” ≈ “Animated Art”).

Directionality
- **A→B = True** if **A** is a type/subclass of **B** (A ⊂ B).
  Example: “Mathematical Optimization” → “Optimization”.
- **B→A = True** if **B** is a type/subclass of **A** (B ⊂ A).
  Example: “Optimization” → “Mathematical Optimization” (rare).
- **Both True** only when **A** and **B** are the same conceptual level with no narrowing modifier.
  Example: “Elementary Statistics” ↔ “Basic Statistics”.
- **Both False** if they differ in domain/level.
  Example: “Animated Art” vs “Graphic Art”.

KEY EXAMPLES
- “Marine Biology” vs “Biology” → (True, False)
- “Cell Biology” vs “Molecular Biology” → (True, True)
- “Life Sciences” vs “Biology” → (False, True)
- “Genetics” vs “Ecology” → (False, False)
- “Managerial Accounting” vs “Accounting” → (True, False)
- “Financial Accounting” vs “Accounting Principles” → (True, True)
- “Business Administration” vs “Accounting” → (False, True)
- “Taxation” vs “Auditing” → (False, False)
- “Sports Coaching” vs “Physical Education” → (True, False)
- “Kinesiology” vs “Exercise Science” → (True, True)
- “Health and Human Performance” vs “Physical Education” → (False, True)
- “Dance Education” vs “Outdoor Recreation” → (False, False)

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Output **only** a CSV wrapped in triple backticks.
- Always wrap A and B in double quotes.
- Columns: "A","B","A->B","B->A"
